# Countdown Timer 

**Countdown Timer** is a simple yet efficient project that displays a countdown timer to a specified target date in days, hours, minutes, and seconds. This project uses JavaScript to calculate the remaining time in real-time and updates the user interface every second. Once the target date is reached, the countdown displays `0` and stops.

## Features

- Dynamic display of the remaining time (days, hours, minutes, seconds)
- Real-time updates using `setInterval()`
- Automatic calculation of the time difference from the current date
- Handles the case where the target date has passed (countdown stops at `0`)
- Easy to integrate into any webpage

## How it Works

The script uses JavaScript to:

1. Define a target end date as a string (e.g., `"June 01, 2030 18:00:00"`).
2. Compare this target date with the current date.
3. Calculate the difference in seconds between the two dates.
4. Convert this difference into days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
5. Update the HTML elements to display the remaining time.
6. If the target date has passed, the countdown stops and displays `0`.

## Usage

To use this countdown timer in your project:

1. Clone or download this project to your local folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/countdown-timer-pro.git
```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the countdown in action.
3. You can modify the target date in the JavaScript file to fit your needs.

```javascript
let endtime = "June 01, 2030 18:00:00";  // Replace with your target date
```

## Example Code

Hereâ€™s a snippet of the JavaScript code used for the countdown:

```javascript
let endtime = "June 01, 2030 18:00:00";
let inputs = document.querySelectorAll("input");

function clock() {
  const NOW = new Date();
  const END = new Date(endtime);
  const diff = (END - NOW) / 1000;

  if (diff < 0) {
    inputs.forEach(input => input.value = 0);
    return;
  }

  let days = Math.floor(diff / (24 * 3600));
  let hours = Math.floor((diff % (24 * 3600)) / 3600);
  let minutes = Math.floor((diff % 3600) / 60);
  let seconds = Math.floor(diff % 60);

  inputs[0].value = days;
  inputs[1].value = hours;
  inputs[2].value = minutes;
  inputs[3].value = seconds;
}

setInterval(clock, 1000);
```
